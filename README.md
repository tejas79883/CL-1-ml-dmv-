Feature Transformation (Any one)
A. To use PCA Algorithm for dimensionality reduction.
You have a dataset that includes measurements for different variables on wine
(alcohol, ash, magnesium, and so on). Apply PCA algorithm & transform this data
so that most variations in the measurements of the variables are captured by a small
number of principal components so that it is easier to distinguish between red and
white wine by inspecting these principal components.

B. Apply LDA Algorithm on Iris Dataset and classify which species a given flower
belongs to.

* 2 Regression Analysis:(Any one)
A. Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off
location. Perform following tasks:
1. Pre-process the dataset.
2. Identify outliers.
3. Check the correlation.
4. Implement linear regression and ridge, Lasso regression models.
5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

B. Use the diabetes data set from UCI and Pima Indians Diabetes data set for performing
the following:
a. Univariate analysis: Frequency, Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard
Deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis
b. Bivariate analysis: Linear and logistic regression modeling
c. Multiple Regression analysis
d. Also compare the results of the above analysis for the two data sets

A. Implement Reinforcement Learning using an example of a maze environment that the
agent needs to explore.
B. Solve the Taxi problem using reinforcement learning where the agent acts as a taxi
driver to pick up a passenger at one location and then drop the passenger off at their
destination.
