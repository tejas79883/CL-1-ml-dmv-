Feature Transformation (Any one)
A. To use PCA Algorithm for dimensionality reduction.
You have a dataset that includes measurements for different variables on wine
(alcohol, ash, magnesium, and so on). Apply PCA algorithm & transform this data
so that most variations in the measurements of the variables are captured by a small
number of principal components so that it is easier to distinguish between red and
white wine by inspecting these principal components.

B. Apply LDA Algorithm on Iris Dataset and classify which species a given flower
belongs to.
